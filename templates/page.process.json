The price points of our handmade ceramics are dictated by carefully calculating the time and energy that go into each piece, and supporting a fair and decent wage for all of our team members. We source our clay from a local manufacturer before hand making, trimming, glazing and firing all of our pieces at our studio in Hood River. Many of our forms are hand-thrown on a potter’s wheel, and in recent years we’ve also begun embracing other pottery tools that allow us to grow and be kinder to our bodies.</p>"
